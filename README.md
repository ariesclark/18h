<h2>What is 18h?</h2>
<p>18h is a Next.js-inspired Koa-router wrapper, which allows you to create routes that match the pattern of your filesystem. This speeds up iteration, while maintaining a serverful architecture.</p>
<p>This library is best used with Node.js & TypeScript in order to unlock all the type-safety capabilities it has to offer.</p>

<h2>Why is it named 18h?</h2>
<p>That is how long Koala's sleep, and all the cooler names were taken.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>Getting started is pretty snappy.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>In order to install the package, in your root directory simply use your favourite package manager in order to install the package. It is registered on the NPM under the name <code>18h</code>.</p>

```bash
npm install 18h
```

<h3>Creating the Router</h3>
<p>First, using your favourite file manager, or the command line, create the folder in which your routes will be stored in. This folder will mirror the structure of your API.</p>

```bash
mkdir routes
```

<p>Once this is complete, we will be able to instantiate our router object by referencing this folder. It's best practice to use the Node.js <code>path</code> module, along with the global <code>__dirname</code> constant in order to ensure the application runs correctly once it is transpiled to JavaScript.</p>

```ts
import { join } from "path";
import { router } from "18h";

router({
  routesFolder: join(__dirname, "routes"),
  port: 8000,
  hostname: "localhost",
});
```

<p>We can also instantiate the 18h router with global middleware that will run prior to every API call.</p>

```ts
const logRequest = async (context, next) => {
  console.log(context);
  await next();
};

router({
  // ...
  middleware: [logRequest],
});
```

<h3>Creating Routes</h3>
<p>Its important to remember that the structure of the filesystem within the routes folder you provide as the <code>routesFolder</code> key is going to mirror the structure of your URLs.</p>

<br>

> **Example**
>
> Assuming you provided a folder called `routes` as the `routesFolder` when creating your router object, creating a file at `routes/index.ts` it will allow consumers to interact with that endpoint at the `http://localhost/` URL.
>
> Creating a file called `routes/example.ts` will allow consumers to interact with that endpoint at the `http://localhost/example` URL.
>
> Creating a file called `routes/example/index.ts` will produce the same result as mentioned above.

> **Note**
>
> Placing square brackets `[]` around the entire name of a folder or file in the routes folder will allow for route parameters to be accepted through that endpoint.
>
> `/a/[b]/c` would become the endpoint path `/a/:b/c`.

<br>

The following file structure would generate the corresponding API endpoint structure.

<h4>File Structure</h4>

```

â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ routes/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts

        â”œâ”€â”€ like.ts
        â””â”€â”€ share.ts
tsconfig.json
```

<h4>Resulting API Path Structure</h4>

```
/
/feed
/user/
/user/delete
/user/settings
/user/settings/private
/user/settings/name
/users/:userId
/users/:userId/block
/users/:userId/follow
/posts
/posts/create
/posts/delete
/posts/like
/posts/share
```

<h4>Adding Logic to Paths</h4>

<p>Of course, we want the paths to do <em>things</em> when someone interacts with them, that logic is defined in <code>RouteController</code> object, which takes multiple <code>MethodControllers</code> in which we define the logic of that endpoint.</p>

<p>Let's start off by creating the logic for the <code>/users/[userId]/block</code> endpoint so we can get a better feel for all the features.</p>

```ts
// src/routes/users/[userId]/block

import { route, method, validation } from "18h";

export default route<{ userId: string }>({
  get: method({
    /** If you are accepting a body, you must
     * define whether it can be `"form"`,
     * `"json"`, or both. */
    accepts: ["json"],
    /** Validation, request, and response schema
     * definition is done in one swoop. Uses "zod"
     * library under the hood. */
    schema: {
      request: validation.null(),
      response: validation.object({
        userId: validation.string(),
      }),
    },
    /** Optional middleware, `pre` will occur
     * before the hanler, while `post` will happen
     * after. */
    middleware: {
      pre: [],
      post: [],
    },
    async handler(context) {
      console.log(context.params.userId); // :userId sourced from URL.
      console.log(context.request.body); // null

      return {
        status: 200,
        headers: {
          "x-custom-header": "true",
        },
        body: {
          userId: "some_id",
        },
      };
    },
  }),
});
```

<h2>Examples</h2>

We can create a simple endpoint that just responds with the node package version of the current project we're in. The endpoint will work on all HTTP methods, not just `GET`, but we could change it to do that by changing all occurances of `all` to `get`.

```ts
import { route, method, validation } from "18h";
const { npm_package_version: version } = process.env;

export default route({
  all: method({
    schema: {
      request: validation.null(),
      response: validation.object({
        version: validation.string().optional(),
      }),
    },
    async handler() {
      return { body: { version } };
    },
  }),
});
```
